Additional notes:

Using MCL to Localize the Robot in the Arena

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is a powerful but complex algorithm that often requires extensive tuning and 
reliable convergence detection. In our setup, we provide a standard deviation-based auto-anchoring mechanism 
to automatically localize (i.e., align the robot’s base frame to the global map frame). However, due to the 
presence of repetitive structures in the arena, MCL can struggle to uniquely localize the robot.

To address this, we offer a manual initialization function that allows you to provide a rough pose estimate 
if the automatic localization fails to converge. We strongly recommend using the manual method first to get 
your MCL node functioning correctly before enabling auto-anchoring. 
  
use the flag " self.use_auto_anchor" to enable/ disable this feature

In summary:

Auto vs Manual Anchoring in MCL

# When self.use_auto_anchor = True

The MCL node will attempt to automatically localize the robot without any external input. Over time, the particles 
will converge to the robot’s true pose, assuming enough motion and distinctive features in the environment.

    - You should see the estimated MCL pose (yellow arrows in RViz) aligning with the true robot location and orientation.
    - The live LiDAR scan should accurately overlap with the map, indicating successful convergence.

# When self.use_auto_anchor = False

Once all nodes are running, you must use the “2D Pose Estimate” button in RViz to manually provide an approximate 
initial pose of the robot.

    - The code will sample particles around the provided pose, allowing for quicker and more reliable convergence of MCL.
    - This is the recommended approach, especially in environments with symmetry or repeated structures, 
      where auto-localization may fail or take longer.

        Performs systematic resampling to generate a new particle set
        based on the current weights.

        Steps:
        1. Normalize particle weights so they sum to 1
        2. Compute cumulative sum of weights (CDF)
        3. Generate N evenly spaced positions in [0, 1) with random offset
        4. Use CDF to select which particles to duplicate based on positions
        5. Create new particles by copying selected ones (with reset weights)

           Why use CDF in practice?
            The CDF converts discrete particle weights into intervals on the [0, 1] line.
            This allows us to map random numbers to particles proportionally to their weights.
            Sampling from the CDF ensures that higher-weight particles are selected more often,
            and lower-weight ones may be skipped — as required by importance sampling.

            example: if weights = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
                            CDF = [0.2, 0.7, 1.0]
                            CDF segment of the probability owned
                            0.2 for particle 0 with w = 0.2  = [0 to 0.2] range
                            0.7 for particle 1 with w = 0.7  = [0.2 to 0.7] range
                            0.3 for particle 2 with w = 0.2 = [0.7 to 1.0] range

                            since the largest weight is 0.5 it also covers the widest range = more chances of selection

                            Now, say we draw a random number 0.65.
                            It falls between 0.2 and 0.7 → we select Particle 1 to ge replicated

        This ensures that high-weight particles are likely duplicated
        multiple times and low-weight ones may disappear.

        Computes the expected robot pose (x, y, theta) as a weighted average
        over all particles. For theta, we compute a weighted average of sine and
        cosine components to properly handle angular wraparound.

        Note: all particles are available under self.particles

        Let T_i = [x_i, y_i, theta_i] be the pose of particle i.
        The estimated mean pose is:

            x = sum(w_i * x_i)
            y = sum(w_i * y_i)
            theta = atan2(sum(w_i * sin(theta_i)), sum(w_i * cos(theta_i)))

        where w_i are the normalized particle weights.

        For the following lines of code
        step 1: find total weights
        step 2: Normalize the weight
        Step 3-6: we're assuming vectorized code to compute x, y, sin_sum, cos_sum for faster processing
                  however, you may use break it to multiple lines of code 
        Step 7: atan2 between sin_sum, and cos_sum for proper angle wrapup
